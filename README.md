    val client = Client("<your API key>")

    // Get Events for a given Date
    val events = client.getEvents(
        // These parameters are the defaults but can be specified:
        // date = "today",
        // timezone = "America/Chicago",
        // adult = false,
    )

    val event = events.events[0]
    println("Today is ${event.name}! Find more information at: ${event.url}.")
    println("Rate limit remaining: ${events.rateLimit.remainingMonth}/${events.rateLimit.limitMonth} (month).")

    // Get Event Information
    val eventInfo = client.getEventInfo(
        id = event.id,
        // These parameters can be specified to calculate the range of eventInfo.Event.Occurrences
        // start = 2020,

    )

    println("The Event's hashtags are ${eventInfo.event.hashtags}.")

    // Search for Events

        // These parameters are the defaults but can be specified:
        // adult = false,
    )

    println("Found ${search.events.size} events, including '${search.events[0].name}', that match the query '${query}'.")
